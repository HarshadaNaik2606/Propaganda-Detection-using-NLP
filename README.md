**📘 Propaganda Detection using NLP**

This project implements multiple NLP models to detect propaganda techniques in text.
It includes traditional machine learning, transformer-based models, span detection, and evaluation frameworks.

**🚀 Project Overview**

This project focuses on two main tasks:

Task 1 — Propaganda Technique Classification

Classify a given span into one of eight propaganda techniques using:

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

BERT Sequence Classification

Task 2 — Span Detection and Technique Labelling

Identify spans containing propaganda and assign the correct label using:

Rule-Based Classifier

BERT BIO Tagging

BERT QA-Based Span Extraction

This project compares traditional ML, deep learning, and rule-based methods in a unified pipeline.
